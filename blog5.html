              <p>"It's raining outside, don't stay out long or you'll catch a cold," she called out from the kitchen. I usually enjoy reading the newspaper on the veranda, basking in the beauty of nature. Ignoring her warning, I grabbed the newspaper and settled into my chair. But a headline caught my eye, "That guy has got out of jail." My heart sank. After all the effort we put in, he's out and his sentence reduced. How will she take this news? My mind was plagued with worry for her. "Don't make me say it again, if you catch cold..." Her voice trailed off from the kitchen.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a voice echoed in my brain, "I will kill you, your family, everyone you love will die by my hand." After being hit by the memory of his threat, my mind drifted into a vivid recollection of the past. I was suddenly transported back to that moment, reliving the fear and anxiety I had felt before.</p>

<p>The valley was quiet and serene as I stood there, waiting for the doctor, a sense of uneasiness settled over me. According to my horoscope, today was the day I would die. Despite my fear, I couldn't help feeling a flutter of excitement at the prospect of seeing my idol. My mind had conjured up an image of her that I couldn't shake. Time slipped by as I waited, and before I knew it, I had dozed off. As I drifted off to sleep, I had a strange dream of a beautiful girl. It felt so real that I woke up feeling disoriented, as though I had just lost something precious.</p>

<p>The sun was beginning to set, casting a warm glow over the valley. It was a serene and peaceful dusk, and the gentle breeze carried with it the sweet scent of flowers that grew wild in the valley. The chirping of birds filled the air, and I closed my eyes to listen to their melodies. It was as if the valley was a secret oasis, untouched by the noise and chaos of the outside world. I sat there for what felt like hours, lost in my thoughts and the beauty of my surroundings.</p>

<p>As time wore on, however, my sense of anticipation and excitement began to wane. The doctor had still not arrived, and I was starting to wonder if I had been foolish to wait. But even as my doubts grew, a part of me clung to the hope that she would come. After all, why would she ask me to meet her here if she didn't plan on showing up?</p>

<p>The sun had disappeared behind the mountains, and the valley was now shrouded in the darkness of night. It was then that I realized the doctor wasn't coming. I had waited through the dusk and into the night, and still, she was nowhere to be seen. I had lost all sense of time and was exhausted, so I made the decision to return home.</p>

<p>As I was driving back home, my mind was filled with thoughts of what could have happened to the doctor. Was she in danger? Did something come up that prevented her from meeting me? My thoughts were interrupted when I suddenly saw a car speeding towards me. Without thinking, I quickly swerved to the side to avoid a collision. However, in my haste to avoid the other car, I lost control of my own vehicle and crashed into a nearby tree. My head hit the steering wheel, and I felt a sharp pain before everything went black.</p>

<p>As I lay in the hospital bed, I couldn't help but feel grateful to be alive. The accident had been a close call, and I knew that if I hadn't swerved in time, I wouldn't be here today. I saw my parents and siblings sitting by my side. They explained to me that I had suffered multiple fractures and my condition was critical. I had been in a coma for several days and would have to remain in the hospital for months to undergo several surgeries and intense physical therapy to recover from my injuries.</p>

<p>As I began my long road to recovery, my family was my rock. They visited me every day, bringing me my favourite food and books to read. Their love and support kept me going, even when the pain was too much to bear. As I lay there in the hospital bed, I couldn't help but feel drawn to the girl from my dream. I was haunted by the dream and the feeling of her presence, as if she was trying to tell me something. It was as if the dream had some kind of connection to my past, particularly with the doctor who had left such a deep impression on me.</p>

<p>Months passed, and with each passing day, I grew stronger. My injuries slowly healed, and I regained the ability to walk and move without assistance. Finally, the day came when I was discharged from the hospital and could return home with my family. Three years had passed, and I still hadn't received any news or phone calls from the mysterious doctor. Time seemed to fly by so quickly, and I was amazed at how much had changed in just a few short years. During that time, I focused on my writing and poured all of my energy into my work. It wasn't long before my book "Trails of Destiny" was published, and my fame as a writer began to grow. I received recognition not only in my home country, but also abroad.</p>

<p>That day, I was about to attend a national writers' meet. I was invited to deliver a speech on my book. I was nervous about facing the prime dignitaries of the nation and making my points in the speech. As I started driving to the venue, I felt a sense of excitement and fear mixed together. I was driving through a bustling road when I received news about an accident that had caused a major traffic jam. That familiar feeling overcame me, and I knew I had to investigate the accident site.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at the scene, I could hear people shouting and cars blaring their horns. The young girl was lying still on the ground, her clothes in tatters, and her face covered in blood. The bystanders' eyes showed their fear and confusion as they stood rooted to the spot, not knowing what to do. Without a second thought, I ran towards the girl and knelt beside her. I checked her pulse and found it to be faint. I quickly called for an ambulance, but it appeared that it would be a while before it arrived. Knowing that time was of the essence, I couldn't wait; the girl needed immediate medical attention.</p>

<p>I carefully lifted her up into my arms, feeling the weight of her body. As I carried her towards my car, I could see that she had a broken arm and a severe cut on her forehead. I tried to keep her conscious and talking, but she was hardly responsive. As I drove to the hospital, I felt a sense of responsibility towards the girl. It was as if destiny had brought us together, and I couldn't let her die.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the hospital, the doctors and nurses quickly came to take her in. I explained to them what had occurred and the extent of her injuries. I waited anxiously in the lobby, hoping that she would survive. I called the coordinators to explain my situation and express my doubts about being able to attend the meeting. To my relief, they were understanding and agreed to postpone my session.</p>

<p>As I sat in the lobby, waiting for my session to begin, my mind wandered back to the accident and my hospitalization. Memories flooded my mind, both good and bad, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of melancholy. Lost in thought, I drifted off to sleep and soon found myself dreaming of the girl I had just admitted to the hospital. As I looked around in the dream, I recognized the familiar backdrop of the valley. Suddenly, everything clicked into place. The dream of the girl, the doctor, and the accident - it all made sense now. There was a connection between them, a thread that tied everything together. It was time to uncover the truth once and for all, and put all the pieces together. And with renewed determination, I prepared to face whatever lay ahead.</p>

<p>The doctors informed me that the girl was out of immediate danger, but needed some rest as she was still weak. She was moved to the ward, and I decided to stay back until she woke up. I was eager to get some answers and understand the connection between her and the enigmatic doctor from my past.</p>

<p>I paid her medical bills and waited patiently for her to wake up. Finally, she opened her eyes, and I could see a faint smile on her face. It seemed like she recognized me, but I couldn't be sure. Was it a gesture of gratitude for saving her life? Before I could say anything, she motioned for me to hear her out. And then, she revealed her true identity - she was the same enigmatic doctor that I had written a book about. My mind was racing with questions and disbelief. How could this be? What was the connection between her and the girl in my dream?</p>

<p>As she spoke, the pieces started falling into place. I finally understood the reason behind my dreams and the connection between the doctor, the girl in my dream, and my accident. It was a surreal moment, and I couldn't believe that I was finally getting some answers. I asked her, why she never came to the valley after asking me to come there. She reminded me of the village she was working for, and the conflict she had with corrupt politicians. Her efforts had put them behind bars for a while, but with their influence, they broke out and regained their political power. They started hunting her down, and to prove their point, they murdered her parents and made it look like an accident. Since then, she has been on the run, avoiding any contact with people from her past.</p>

<p>She apologized for being the reason for my accident and explained that the politician might have thought we had a relationship. After hearing about my accident, she had tried to stay away from me. Despite her efforts to stay out of trouble, fate had brought us back together again. She elaborated that she possessed incriminating evidence against the corrupt politician who had perpetrated egregious offenses, such as the brutal slaying of her loved ones. The politician knew she was a threat to them, which is why they were trying to hunt her down. She had called me because I was a writer and she believed that I could help her expose them. She asked if I could help her again, as she felt that fate had brought us together for this reason. I was left speechless and at a loss for words. She repeated her request, and suddenly I woke up with a start. At that moment, I knew that it was my destiny to help this girl.</p>

<p>I called in all my favours to verify the evidence that the girl had against the corrupt politician. After conducting a thorough investigation, I was convinced that the evidence was enough to bring the villains to justice. Without wasting any time, I sent the evidence to the media. In the end, the media's relentless coverage forced the judiciary to take a second look at the case. Thanks to the irrefutable evidence, the corrupt politician was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. As he was being led away, he turned to us and shouted, "I will make you pay for this, I will..."</p>

<p>I walked into the kitchen, I knew that she could sense something was wrong just by looking at me. Her eyes met mine, and I saw the concern in her expression.</p>

<p>Before she could even ask, I blurted out the news, "He's out of prison." I watched as the colour drained from her face, her worry and fear palpable in the air. For a moment, we just stood there, unsure of what to say or do.</p>

<p>Finally, I took a deep breath and asked my wife to stay with my family abroad, where she could be with loved ones and feel safe while I figured out our next move. It wasn't an easy decision, but I knew that it was the right one for the moment.</p>

<p>My wife nodded slowly, her expression pensive, but I could see the determination in her eyes. Together, we would face whatever challenges lay ahead, even if that meant being apart for a while. I watched as my wife began to pack her bags, her movements slow and deliberate. I couldn't believe that we were actually doing this, but I knew that it was necessary. She needed to be safe, and I needed to figure out our next steps.</p>

<p>As I helped her pack, memories flooded my mind. Memories of our life together, the good times and the bad. I couldn't help but wonder how we had ended up here, in this situation. It seemed like just yesterday we were starting our life together, full of hope and dreams.</p>

<p>Finally, it was time for my wife to leave. We made our way to the airport, both of us silent. As we stood at the gate, waiting for her flight to be called, I took a deep breath and hugged her tightly.</p>

<p>"I love you," I whispered, my voice choked with emotion.</p>

<p>"I love you too," she replied, tears streaming down her face.</p>

<p>And then, it was time for her to go. I watched as she walked down the jet way, disappearing from sight. A part of me went with her, and I knew that life would never be the same again.</p>

<p>After seeing my wife off at the airport, I returned home with a sense of determination burning inside me. I knew what I had to do to keep my family safe, even if it meant delving into the darker corners of my past. I headed to the store room and opened an old suitcase, filled with papers and documents from years ago. It was as if I had been waiting for this moment, as if I knew that one day, I would need to access these secrets. I picked up the phone and dialled a number, my voice low and steady. The person on the other end was clearly afraid, stuttering out a greeting before I cut them off. "I want him. No one threatens my family. Let me know his location."</p>

<p>As I hung up the phone, I felt a sense of satisfaction mingled with unease. It had been too easy, too simple. I knew that this was only the beginning, that there were still more secrets to uncover and more dangers to face. I reached into the hidden compartment of the suitcase and pulled out a Beretta, feeling the weight of the weapon in my hand. I tried to load the magazine, but my hands were shaking with a mix of fear and adrenaline. I knew I had to keep my wits about me, that I couldn't let my emotions get in the way.</p>

<p>I slipped the gun into the back of my jeans, feeling its reassuring presence against my skin. As I walked out of the store room, my eyes fell on the photo of my wife and me, hanging in the hall. I had promised to protect her, but at what cost? How much of myself was I willing to sacrifice to keep her safe? I pushed those doubts aside, knowing that there was no turning back now. The past had caught up with me, and I had no choice but to face it head-on.</p>
