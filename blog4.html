              <h3 class="mb-4">In Search of Destiny</h3>
              <p>I was never the favourite child in my family. Growing up in an upper-middle-class family, there was always a certain standard to meet. I was an average guy in a world where everyone wants the best. My parents always had a rein on my life, and I never had a chance to enjoy it. My horoscope predicted an early death, which only fuelled my parents' anxiety about my future. As a result, they never let me make my own choices. Despite their wishes, I was always interested in literature. My parents, on the other hand, wanted me to become an engineer, and for their sake, I completed my B.Tech. They wanted me to work in a software corp, but I never enjoyed working with computers, even though I was good at it. I decided to rebel and started freelance writing.</p>

<p>The pay wasn't good, and my articles didn't get much recognition. My parents started to irritate me, saying that I was throwing away a promising career. It was then that I decided to leave home and start traveling to various places to find my inspiration and destiny. I had the opportunity to visit a remote village. There, I heard the story of a valiant girl who brought revolutionary changes to the village as a doctor. Unfortunately, she was away on a medical mission, so I didn't get a chance to meet her. Nonetheless, I got a plot to write about her, an untold heroic act.</p>

<p>As a writer, I was inspired by the doctor's story and felt compelled to share it with the world. When I returned home, I immediately started working on a book about her, diving deep into research and interviews with the villagers. Though I had never met her face-to-face, I admired her deeply. After months of writing, I completed the book and sent it to various publishers, hoping to bring the doctor's story to a wider audience. But rejection after rejection came my way, and I began to feel discouraged. However, I refused to give up on my dream of sharing her story. One day, I came across a famous newspaper that had an open submission policy for articles. I decided to take a chance and sent in a piece on the doctor's efforts. I never expected it to be published, but to my surprise, it was. The article brought me much attention as a freelancer, and I began to receive offers from various publications. As my fame grew, I continued to write articles on different topics, but the doctor's story remained close to my heart.</p>

<p>Though I didn't keep track of the doctor's news, I had an experience that changed my life. One day, I received a letter from a reader who had read my article and recognized the doctor's efforts. She told me that she was inspired by the doctor's story and wanted to contribute to the cause. I realized then that the power of storytelling is not just in sharing information but also in inspiring others to act. The doctor's story had not only touched my life but also the lives of many others.</p>

<p>One day, I had the opportunity to interview a famous astrologist who was visiting my city for a lecture. I was assigned to write an article about his predictions for the coming year. As we spoke, the astrologist took a look at my birth chart and made a shocking prediction - he said that I would have an early death. His words had a profound impact on me, as everything he said about me was true. I had always felt like something was off in my life, and his prediction only added to my anxiety about the future. However, the astrologist didn't just leave me with a grim prediction. He asked me to find my destiny, as it might be the only way to rescue me from the fate he foresaw. His words stayed with me long after the interview ended, and I started to keep an eye out for signs that could lead me to my destiny.</p>

<p>I couldn't shake off the uneasy feeling that had been growing inside me ever since the psychic's prediction. It felt like a dark cloud hanging over my head, threatening to rain down upon me at any moment. I knew I had to do something to change the course of my life. So, I decided to hit the road again and travel like I used to, to live in the moment and forget about the future. But in the back of my mind, I kept thinking about the doctor. She had been a turning point in my life, and I couldn't help but wonder where she was now. I decided to try and track her down, to see if she could help me find some peace of mind.</p>

<p>I contacted a few people I knew who might have some information, but it was a dead end. All I could find out was that her parents had died in an accident, and she had left town. I felt a sense of despair wash over me. I couldn't believe that I had missed the chance to reconnect with someone who had meant so much to me. Days passed, and just when I thought all hope was lost, I received a phone call. The voice on the other end was familiar, but I couldn't quite place it. Then she revealed herself as the doctor, and I felt a sense of relief wash over me. But her words quickly shattered that feeling.</p>

<p>She told me that her parents were murdered and that she needed my help. I was stunned, not knowing what to say or do. She asked me to meet her at the valley, but wouldn't give me any more information over the phone. As I hung up the phone, my heart was racing with a mix of fear and anticipation. Who could have murdered her parents? And why did she need my help? The answers to these questions felt just out of reach, like a hazy dream that I couldn't quite grasp. But one thing was certain - I needed to meet the doctor at the valley and uncover the secrets that she was hiding. The stakes were high, and the air around me felt thick with danger and uncertainty.</p>
