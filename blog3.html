              <p>As a freelance writer, I travelled to various places to seek inspiration for my writing, some of which were beautiful and inspiring, while others were not as pleasant. One day, I decided to visit a valley that was known for its scenic beauty. As I walked through the valley, a positive presence accompanied me, but it also made me feel sluggish. I decided to take a nap, and that's when I had a vivid dream about a beautiful girl. She looked like an angel or fairy, and I was captivated by her beauty.</p>

<p>The next day, I woke up feeling uneasy as my horoscope had predicted that I would die that day. I tried to shake off the feeling and went about my day. However, fate had something else in store for me. As I was driving down a busy road, a speeding car collided with mine. The impact was so powerful that my car spun out of control and crashed into a tree. I blacked out and didn't remember what happened next.</p>

<p>When I woke up, I was lying in a hospital bed surrounded by doctors and nurses. They informed me that I had suffered multiple fractures, and my condition was critical. I was in a coma for several days and remained in the hospital for months. I underwent several surgeries and intense physical therapy to recover from my injuries. Despite the physical pain, the emotional pain was even more profound.</p>

<p>As I lay in the hospital bed, recovering from my injuries, I felt a deep sense of gratitude. I was thankful to be alive, but at the same time, I was also confused. I couldn't understand why I had survived the accident when my horoscope had predicted my death. Was it all just a coincidence, or was there something more to it? As I pondered these questions, I couldn't help but feel drawn to the girl from my dream. I was haunted by the dream of the girl and the feeling of her presence. I wondered if she was real or just a figment of my imagination. As I recovered, I couldn't shake off the feeling that my accident was somehow connected to the dream and the girl.</p>

<p>Days passed, and I slowly started to forget about the accident. One day, I was driving my car through a busy road when I heard about an accident that had caused heavy traffic. I felt that familiar presence again, and I knew I had to check on the accident spot. As I reached the accident scene, I could hear people yelling and cars honking. The girl was lying motionless on the ground, her clothes torn and her face covered in blood. I could see the fear in the eyes of the onlookers as they stood frozen, not knowing what to do.</p>

<p>Without thinking twice, I ran towards the girl and knelt down beside her. I checked her pulse and found it to be weak. I quickly called for an ambulance, but it seemed like it would take a while before it arrived. I knew I couldn't wait that long; the girl needed immediate medical attention.</p>

<p>I carefully picked her up in my arms, and I could feel the weight of her body. As I carried her to my car, I could see that she had a broken arm and a deep cut on her forehead. I tried to keep her conscious and talking, but she was barely responding. As I drove towards the hospital, I couldn't help but feel a sense of responsibility towards this girl. I knew that I had to do everything in my power to save her life. It was as if fate had brought us together, and I couldn't let her slip away.</p>

<p>As we reached the hospital, the doctors and nurses rushed to take her in. I explained to them what had happened and the extent of her injuries. I watched as they wheeled her away, hoping and praying that she would pull through. I waited in the lobby, hoping that she would survive. As I sat there, I felt sleepy and dozed off. In my sleep, I had the same dream I had on the day I visited the valley. The girl in my dream was the same as the one lying in the hospital bed.</p>

<p>I woke up with a start, and at that moment, I knew that this was my destiny. I had to help this girl, and in doing so, I had fulfilled my purpose in life. As I looked at the girl, I felt a strange sense of peace. It was as if my life had come full circle, and I had found my true calling.</p>
